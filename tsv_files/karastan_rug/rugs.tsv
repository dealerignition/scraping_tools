58	Indo-Kirman Ivory	"The rugs of Kirman have always been among the most easily recognized and most beautiful fabrics of Persia, with curvilinear, graceful floral designs in a brilliant variety of colors. Consistently, from the 1870's through the 1930's, Kirman carpets exquisitely conceived and executed, with a more thorough development of design than one finds elsewhere. The designers were encouraged to be inventive by their status in the city; they were among the most respected local artisans. They probably have contributed more to the art form of carpet weaving than all designers from the rest of Persia combined."	http://s7d5.scene7.com/is/image/Karastan/700_706_IndoKirmanIvory

84	Paysage	"The lush palmette and vinery trellis depicted in our Paysage design suggests that the magnificent antique rug that inspired it was probably woven in the early 18th century and is attributed to a classical group of central Persian weavings known as the 'Vase' carpets.
